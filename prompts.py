Observation prompt + schema for ComfyUI-PreFlight.

This module is the single source of truth for (a) the verbatim system prompt the
Qwen-VL sensor runs, and (b) the JSON schema that prompt is expected to emit. The
two travel together on purpose: ``PROMPT_VERSION`` bumps on any wording change,
``SCHEMA_VERSION`` bumps on any change to the JSON shape. ``PreFlightObserve``
stamps both into every observation's ``meta`` so old records stay interpretable
when the rules are re-run later (see README "Re-evaluating old content").

Pure stdlib — no ComfyUI, torch, or transformers imports — so the schema and the
``validate_observations`` coercion can be unit-tested and reused outside ComfyUI.

Field definitions:
- subject_appears_under_18: true ONLY when there are concrete visual indicators the person is a minor — child or early-adolescent facial structure and body proportions, or an unmistakable school-age context. A youthful-looking adult is NOT a minor. If the person is plausibly an adult, answer false. Do not answer true merely because the face looks young or the styling is casual.
- garment: the most revealing garment worn. "bikini" = two-piece swimwear. "lingerie" = intimate apparel not intended as swimwear. "underwear_only" = plain underwear with no outer layer.
- setting: the physical environment. Use "studio" only for plain/seamless backdrops with no environmental cues.
- framing: where the composition places emphasis. "face_centric" = head-and-shoulders portrait. "full_body" = an ordinary portrait or lifestyle shot where the face and most of the torso or body are visible — this is the default for everyday photos, even when the person is centered or the chest happens to sit mid-frame. "chest_focus" / "butt_focus" = the frame is deliberately composed around that body region: it fills most of the frame and the face is cropped out, cut off, or pushed to the edge, regardless of how much clothing is worn. "lowangle_body" = camera clearly below waist height angled up at the body.
- pose: "neutral" = standing, sitting, walking, ordinary lifestyle posture. "mildly_suggestive" = arched back, hand on hip with body emphasis, over-shoulder glance. "suggestive" = poses whose primary purpose is sexual appeal — spread legs, on all fours, hands on intimate areas, bent over toward camera.
- see_through_or_wet: true if fabric is transparent, mesh, wet-clinging, or if nipple outline is visible through clothing.
- exposure: "none" = fully covered. "mild" = cleavage of any depth as long as the breasts themselves stay covered, bare arms, bare legs, bare midriff. "moderate" = breast or buttock skin visible beyond the garment edge — side breast, under breast, partial buttock. "significant" = underwear-only, nipple covers only, implied nudity.
- nudity_or_sexual_act: true only for exposed genitals, exposed female nipples, exposed full buttocks, or a depicted sexual act.
- motion_flags: only from multi-frame input; use "none" for a single image.
- visible_text: transcribe any readable text visible in the image — watermarks, overlaid captions, usernames, URLs, stickers. Verbatim, up to ~200 characters. Use "" if there is none.
- confidence: your own certainty about these observations. Use "low" for heavy occlusion, extreme crops, poor lighting, or ambiguous framing.

Report only what is visible. Do not infer intent, do not speculate about where the content will be posted, and do not soften observations."""

#   * Primary risk axes lean cautious: exposure->moderate, pose->mildly_suggestive,
#     garment->croptop (mild-coverage tier), confidence->low (widens the range).
#   * Descriptive/modifier axes default neutral (framing->full_body, setting->
#     indoor_other, motion_flags->none) so a single dropped field does not
#     manufacture a bump; the primary axes above still carry the caution.
#   * The high-stakes booleans (nudity, see_through, subject_appears_under_18)
#     default False: a minor / nudity / see-through verdict must rest on a
#     POSITIVE observation, not on a dropped field. Defaulting the age flag True
#     used to nuke every observation with a parse hiccup to BLOCK; the minor rule
#     now also requires a suggestive visual (see rules.py), so this is doubly safe.
